# Salary-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting an individual's salary based on their years of experience (or education level) using Simple Linear Regression. The dataset contains records of experience versus corresponding salaries, which serves as the foundation for building the predictive model. The workflow begins with loading and exploring the dataset, followed by fitting a regression line to model the relationship between experience and salary. Residual analysis is performed to evaluate model accuracy and detect possible deviations or outliers.

For deployment, the project uses Streamlit to create an interactive web application. The app features a slider that allows users to select their years of experience, instantly displaying the predicted salary alongside a graphical visualization of the regression line. This approach provides an intuitive, user-friendly tool for quick salary estimation. The combination of statistical modeling and interactive visualization ensures both accuracy and accessibility, making the solution practical for HR analytics, career planning, and recruitment forecasting.
